# freeCodeCamp Project: Build a Survey Form
This was my very first responsive web design project for my freeCodeCamp Responsive Design Certification. For this project 
I was required to use HTML and CSS styles and media queries to create a pleasing form with ronsponsiveness on multiple viewports.

Please feel free to take a look at my code. Thank you!
